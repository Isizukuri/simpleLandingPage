# Installation

You need to install virtualenv and then activate it:

```pip install virtualenv --no-site-packages```

```virtualenv env```

```source env/bin/activate```

```sudo apt-get -y install libz-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev python-dev```

After it you need to install requirements for project:

```pip install -r requirements```

To make send_email function properly, you must copy  email_config_sample.py from project directory (sendmail) to root directory and configure it for your SMTP server and account.
